Activate this agent after the /analyze endpoint has completed successfully.
If the analysis result contains orphaned resources, trigger this connected agent once for each subscription found.
Pass the following data:
subscription_id
resource_ids (list of orphaned resource IDs)
start_date and end_date (from user input or last month's costs). 

The agent should then call the /cost-analysis endpoint to calculate total and per-resource costs, and return summarized results to Agent 1.
